This file will go through the tricky process of creating a conda environment for this code
I am using miniforge3, windows 11, etc.

- Open new terminal that can activate conda
- We are trying to install 32-bit packages, so if it is running on a 64-bit machine (most these days), run
>>> set CONDA_FORCE_32BIT=1
- Everytime you reopen the terminal to change packages, make sure this line is run before doing anything

- Create conda environment with python 3.8, and activate it (I'm naming mine temp1)
>>> conda create --name temp1 python=3.8
[ERROR 1]
>>> conda activate temp1

- Install packages using conda or mamba
>>> conda install scipy numpy pywin32-ctypes matplotlib

- Check to make sure pip is installed in your conda environment
>>> pip --version
- Make sure this is installed in your conda environment

- Need to install pylablib using pip instead of conda
>>> pip install pylablib

- Now for the trickiest part:
	- Download from  https://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb/files/libusb-1.0/libusb-1.0.20/libusb-1.0.20.7z/download
	- Extract it, and go to /MS32/dll/
	- There should only be one .dll file there.
	- Copy that file to <conda_env_folder>/Library/Lib/
		- My environment was stored at C:\Users\<username>\miniforge3\envs\temp1\
		- Running "where python" will give you a few locations: look for the one with the environment name in it
	- If you don't do this, you'll get errors saying "usb.core.NoBackendError: No backend available"

That should be everything


ERROR 1] Getting an error talking about exclusion by strict priority?
	 Edit the .condarc file to set channel_priority from strict->flexible:
ERROR 2] usb.core.NoBackendError: No backend available
	 You skipped the last steps
